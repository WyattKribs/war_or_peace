## Wyatt's War or Peace

This is my War or Peace project, composed of 6 object files, tests for the objects, and the runner file.
When running the war_or_peace file in the terminal it plays a game of war up to 1million turns using a standard 52 card deck that has been randomized and split between two players. All the tests bring back the correct information and the game plays out as it (theoretically) should.
